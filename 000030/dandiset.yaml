description: A Neuropixels recording from a head-fixed mouse acquired at the Allen
  Institute for Brain Science. The recording has a duration of 15 minutes, 246 active
  recording channels (the remaining of the 384 Neuropixels channels were either not
  inserted in the brain tissue or below a firing rate of 0.1~Hz), and a sampling frequency
  of 30~kHz. The probe records from part of the cortex (V1), the hippocampus (CA1),
  the dentate gyrus, and the thalamus (LP).
