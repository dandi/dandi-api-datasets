description: The head-direction (HD) system functions as a compass, with member neurons
  robustly increasing their firing rates when the animal's head points in a specific
  direction. HD neurons may be driven by peripheral sensors or, as computational models
  postulate, internally generated (attractor) mechanisms. We addressed the contributions
  of stimulus-driven and internally generated activity by recording ensembles of HD
  neurons in the antero-dorsal thalamic nucleus and the post-subiculum of mice by
  comparing their activity in various brain states. The temporal correlation structure
  of HD neurons was preserved during sleep, characterized by a 60°-wide correlated
  neuronal firing (activity packet), both within and across these two brain structures.
  During rapid eye movement sleep, the spontaneous drift of the activity packet was
  similar to that observed during waking and accelerated tenfold during slow-wave
  sleep. These findings demonstrate that peripheral inputs impinge on an internally
  organized network, which provides amplification and enhanced precision of the HD
  signal.
