description: Extracellular electrophysiology recordings performed on mouse anterior
  lateral motor cortex (ALM) in delay response task. Neural activity from two neuron
  populations, pyramidal track upper and lower, were characterized, in relation to
  movement execution. Some files, as originally (re)distributed from e.g. http://datasets.datalad.org/?dir=/labs/svoboda/Economo_2018
  were found to be broken and would not be able available among reorganized files
  under sub-* directories.
